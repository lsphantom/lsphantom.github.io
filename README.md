# Gary Pacheco
**Senior Frontend Engineer**\
**[lsphantom.github.io](https://lsphantom.github.io)**

Iâ€™m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, lovable, and thougthful interfaces that merge great visual design with robust engineering. I like connecting the dots between design and development, creating experiences that look great and have extensive functionality and usability.

In the early parts of my career development, I've had the opportunity to work in a variety of fields, such as education, science, non-profit organizations, automotive, and more. 
I love being a jack-of-all trades while mastering the skills that I enjoy utilizing the most.
On my spare time I like to spend time with family and friends, and doing things that are mostly not screen related; so I enjoy the beach, mountains, working on cars, building things with my hands, exploring new music, and grilling delicious Latin American foods.

Here are some of the things I've been busy with:
